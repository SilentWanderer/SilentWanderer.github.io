title: About Me
---

I'm currently a first-year Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech with a passion for software design, robotics, space, and literature. In my free time, I volunteer for the [TREC Lab](http://www.me.vt.edu/research/laboratories/trec/), work on controls for the [BOLT Electric Motorcycle](http://www.bolt.org.vt.edu), and do personal projects.

I previously attended Battlefield High School as part of the IT Speciality Program. During my time there, I participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition with Team 1885, [ILITE Robotics](http://ilite.us) and in the [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org) program.

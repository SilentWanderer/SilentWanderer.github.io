    <h3> Autonomous Routine Generator </h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/SilentWanderer/AutonomousGenerator"> GitHub Link </a>
    <p>
      This was my final project for AP Computer Science. 
      The goal was to produce a piece of software that could calculate the distances and angles used to determine the movement of a robot using a GUI. 
      This was achieved through both a simple "list" interface that allowed "move" and "turn" commands to be added and removed from a queue and
      a more advanced "field" interface that allowed the user to specify points that they wanted the robot to drive to. The program was also capable of outputting the calculated measures to a
      text file for easy integration into robot code.

    <h3> Game Boy Emulator in Kotlin </h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/SilentWanderer/gb-emu"> GitHub Link </a>
    <p>
      This is a project I work on occasionally to "cool off" from robotics, as well as learn a new language and
      improve my software design skills

    <h3> Robotics Contributions </h3>
    <p>
      I've been writing software for ILITE Robotics for three years.
      Our projects range from high-frequency path tracking
      to computer vision targeting.

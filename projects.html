<h3> Autonomous Routine Generator </h3>
<a href="https://github.com/SilentWanderer/AutonomousGenerator"> GitHub Link </a>
<p>
    This was my final project for AP Computer Science.
    The goal was to produce a piece of software that could calculate the distances and angles used to determine the
    movement of a robot using a GUI.
    This was achieved through both a simple "list" interface that allowed "move" and "turn" commands to be added and
    removed from a queue and
    a more advanced "field" interface that allowed the user to specify points that they wanted the robot to drive to.
    The program was also capable of outputting the calculated measures to a
    text file for easy integration into robot code.

<h3> Game Boy Emulator in Kotlin </h3>
<a href="https://github.com/SilentWanderer/gb-emu"> GitHub Link </a>
<p>
    This is a project I work on occasionally to "cool off" from robotics, as well as learn a new language and
    improve my software design skills. Currently "on hold".

<h3> Robotics Contributions </h3>
<p>
    I wrote robot code for three years as part of the software team for ILITE Robotics,
    leading the team for my final two years.

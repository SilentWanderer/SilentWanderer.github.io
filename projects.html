    <h3> Autonomous Routine Generator </h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/SilentWanderer/AutonomousGenerator"> GitHub Link </a>
    <p>This was my final project for AP Computer Science. 
      The goal was to produce a piece of software that could calculate the distances and angles used to determine the movement of a robot using a GUI. 
      This was achieved through both a simple "list" interface that allowed "move" and "turn" commands to be added and removed from a queue and
      a more advanced "field" interface that allowed the user to specify points that they wanted the robot to drive to. The program was also capable of outputting the calculated measures to a
      text file for easy integration into robot code.
